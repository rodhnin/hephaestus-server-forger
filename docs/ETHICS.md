# Ethical Use & Legal Guidelines

## Overview

**Hephaestus is designed exclusively for authorized server security testing.** This document outlines the ethical principles, legal requirements, and best practices that govern the use of this tool.

---

## 🚨 Legal Requirements

### You MUST Have Authorization

Before scanning any server with Hephaestus, you **must** have one of the following:

1. **Ownership**: You own the target server/infrastructure
2. **Explicit Written Permission**: Signed agreement from the system owner
3. **Professional Engagement**: Formal penetration testing contract with clear scope
4. **Bug Bounty Program**: Participation within defined scope and rules

### What Counts as Authorization?

✅ **Valid Authorization:**

-   Signed penetration testing agreement with defined scope
-   Email from authorized IT/security personnel explicitly granting permission
-   Bug bounty program participation (within scope and rules)
-   Internal corporate testing with management approval and documentation
-   Your own personal server/website/infrastructure
-   Development/staging environments you control

❌ **NOT Valid Authorization:**

-   Verbal permission without written documentation
-   Permission from non-authorized users (e.g., junior developer without authority)
-   "Just testing security as a favor" without formal approval
-   Public servers without explicit consent
-   Government/military systems without proper clearance
-   Third-party servers (e.g., apache.org, nginx.com, example.com)
-   "It's publicly accessible, so it's okay to scan" (WRONG!)

---

## ⚖️ Legal Frameworks

### United States: Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA)

The CFAA (18 U.S.C. § 1030) makes it illegal to:

-   Access a computer without authorization or exceed authorized access
-   Intentionally access a computer without authorization and obtain information
-   Knowingly cause transmission of a program/code that causes damage
-   Traffic in passwords or similar access credentials

**Penalties**: Up to 20 years imprisonment + fines up to $250,000

**Notable Cases:**

-   Operators probing servers they didn't own: Criminal charges
-   Security researchers testing without permission: Federal prosecution

### United Kingdom: Computer Misuse Act 1990

Prohibits:

-   **Section 1**: Unauthorized access to computer material
-   **Section 2**: Unauthorized access with intent to commit further offenses
-   **Section 3**: Unauthorized modification of computer material
-   **Section 3A**: Making, supplying or obtaining articles for use in offenses

**Penalties**: Up to 10 years imprisonment + unlimited fines

### European Union: GDPR & National Laws

-   **GDPR Article 32**: Requires testing of security measures (BUT testing must be authorized)
-   **Network and Information Systems (NIS) Directive**: Security obligations for operators
-   **Cybersecurity Act**: EU-wide cybersecurity framework
-   Various EU member states have additional cybercrime laws

**Key Points:**

-   Authorized penetration testing is ENCOURAGED for critical infrastructure
-   Unauthorized testing is CRIMINAL regardless of intent

### Other Jurisdictions

Most countries have similar laws:

-   **Canada**: Criminal Code (Section 342.1 - Unauthorized use of computer)
-   **Australia**: Cybercrime Act 2001
-   **India**: IT Act 2000 (Section 66 - Computer-related offenses)
-   **China**: Cybersecurity Law (严格监管)
-   **Brazil**: Marco Civil da Internet + General Data Protection Law (LGPD)

**Universal Principle**: "I didn't know it was illegal" is NOT a defense anywhere.

## 🛡️ Hephaestus Built-In Safeguards

### 1. Safe-by-Default Architecture

-   **Default mode**: `--safe` (non-intrusive checks only)

    -   No brute force attempts
    -   No exploit attempts
    -   No file modifications
    -   No login attempts
    -   Rate limited to 3 req/s (respectful)

-   **Aggressive mode**: `--aggressive` (deeper probing)
    -   **Requires verified consent token**
    -   Extended file checks (400+ paths)
    -   Higher rate limit (8 req/s)
    -   More comprehensive testing

### 2. Consent Token Verification System

Hephaestus **requires** ownership verification before:

-   `--aggressive` mode (deep scanning)
-   `--use-ai` (sends sanitized data to external AI API)

**Token Methods:**

-   **HTTP**: Place token file at `https://yourdomain.com/.well-known/verify-{token}.txt`
-   **DNS**: Add TXT record `hephaestus-verify={token}` to your domain

**Token Properties:**

-   48-hour expiration (prevents stale authorizations)
-   Cryptographically random (prevents guessing)
-   Stored in shared database (`~/.argos/argos.db`)
-   Audit trail for compliance

**Purpose**: Technical proof of server control, NOT a replacement for legal authorization.

### 3. Comprehensive Logging & Auditing

All actions are logged with timestamps:

-   Targets scanned (URLs, IPs, domains)
-   Scan mode used (safe/aggressive)
-   Consent verification events (success/failure)
-   Findings discovered (with severity levels)
-   Errors and exceptions
-   API calls (when using AI features)

**Log Security:**

-   Automatic secret redaction (API keys, credentials, tokens)
-   Multiple verbosity levels (`-v`, `-vv`, `-vvv`)
-   JSON and text format support
-   Timestamped with severity levels

**Legal Protection**: Logs are evidence of ethical and authorized usage.

## 📋 Best Practices

### Before Scanning

1. **Document Authorization**

    - Get written permission from authorized personnel
    - Define scope clearly:
        - Specific domains/subdomains
        - IP ranges (if applicable)
        - Allowed scan types (safe vs aggressive)
        - Time windows (business hours vs off-hours)
    - Specify permitted actions and depth
    - Include emergency contact information

2. **Inform Stakeholders**

    - Notify IT/security operations teams in advance
    - Provide your contact information
    - Establish communication channels (email, Slack, phone)
    - Set up monitoring alerts (so your scans don't trigger false alarms)
    - Document escalation procedures

3. **Verify Consent Token**

    - Always verify domain ownership before aggressive mode
    - Keep proof of verification (screenshot, log output)
    - Verify token hasn't expired
    - Re-verify if scope changes

4. **Test in Non-Production First**
    - Start with development/staging environments
    - Validate scan behavior and impact
    - Confirm rate limits are appropriate
    - Check for false positives

### During Scanning

1. **Respect Scope Boundaries**

    - Stay within authorized targets only
    - Don't follow redirects to external domains
    - Don't exceed agreed scan depth
    - Honor time restrictions (avoid peak hours if requested)

2. **Monitor Impact**

    - Watch for service degradation or errors
    - Use rate limiting (`--rate`) appropriately
    - Adjust threads (`--threads`) based on server capacity
    - Stop immediately if issues detected

3. **Avoid Harmful Actions**

    - **Never** modify server files or configurations
    - **Never** attempt privilege escalation
    - **Never** download sensitive data (credentials, PII)
    - **Never** disrupt services or cause DoS conditions
    - **Never** attempt to bypass authentication

4. **Maintain Communication**
    - Notify stakeholders when scan starts/ends
    - Report any concerning findings immediately
    - Document any unexpected behavior
    - Keep audit trail of all activities

### After Scanning

1. **Secure Reports**

    - Encrypt sensitive findings before transmission
    - Limit report distribution to authorized personnel only
    - Use secure channels (encrypted email, secure file transfer)
    - Store reports securely with access controls
    - Set retention policies and follow them

2. **Responsible Disclosure**

    - Report vulnerabilities to server owner first (private disclosure)
    - Provide clear description with reproduction steps
    - Allow reasonable time for fixes:
        - **Critical**: 7-14 days
        - **High**: 30 days
        - **Medium/Low**: 90 days
    - Don't publicly disclose before patches are available
    - Coordinate disclosure timeline with vendor

3. **Clean Up**
    - Remove test files if any were created
    - Delete logs on target system (if any)
    - Revoke consent tokens when engagement ends
    - Securely delete local reports when no longer needed
    - Update documentation with lessons learned

## 🔍 Hephaestus-Specific Guidelines

### Consent Token Implementation

**Technical Detail**: Hephaestus's consent token is a technical safeguard, NOT a legal authorization.

**What It Is:**

-   Cryptographic proof you control the target server
-   Prevents accidental scanning of wrong targets
-   Creates audit trail for compliance purposes
-   Required for aggressive mode and AI analysis

**What It Is NOT:**

-   Legal permission (still need written authorization)
-   Protection against prosecution if unauthorized
-   Substitute for proper contracts or bug bounty terms

**Best Practices:**

-   Generate unique token per engagement
-   Document token generation date/time
-   Revoke tokens immediately after engagement ends
-   Keep tokens confidential (treat like passwords)

### AI Analysis Privacy & Security

When using `--use-ai` with cloud providers (OpenAI, Anthropic):

**What Gets Sent:**

-   Server type and version (Apache 2.4.54, Nginx 1.18.0, etc.)
-   List of findings (titles and descriptions)
-   Severity levels
-   Generic remediation context

**What Gets REMOVED (sanitized automatically):**

-   Consent tokens
-   API keys and credentials
-   Private keys and certificates
-   Internal IP addresses
-   Database connection strings
-   Session tokens
-   Any PII (personally identifiable information)

**Privacy Options:**

1. **Ollama (Local Models)**: 100% offline, no data leaves your machine

    - Recommended for: Government, healthcare, finance, highly sensitive systems
    - Trade-off: Slower (28 min CPU vs 35s cloud)

2. **OpenAI**: Standard privacy (encrypted in transit, OpenAI privacy policy applies)

    - Recommended for: General commercial use

3. **Anthropic Claude**: Enhanced privacy (Anthropic's privacy-first approach)
    - Recommended for: Privacy-conscious organizations

**Best Practice**: Use Ollama for sensitive infrastructure, cloud AI for general testing.

### Database Security & Privacy

`~/.argos/argos.db` contains potentially sensitive information:

-   Scan history with targets
-   Findings (vulnerability details)
-   Consent tokens
-   Timestamps and metadata

**Protect This File:**

```bash
# Restrict permissions (owner read/write only)
chmod 600 ~/.argos/argos.db

# Encrypt your home directory (full disk encryption)
# Linux: LUKS, Windows: BitLocker, macOS: FileVault

# Don't commit to version control
echo ".argos/" >> ~/.gitignore

# Securely delete when engagement ends
shred -vfz -n 10 ~/.argos/argos.db
```

**Shared Database Note:**

-   Hephaestus shares database with Argus (WordPress scanner) and future Argos suite tools
-   All tools respect same consent/authorization framework
-   Cross-tool findings correlation for unified vulnerability tracking

### Report Handling

**JSON Reports** (`~/.hephaestus/reports/*.json`):

-   Machine-readable, ~15-25KB
-   Contains full vulnerability details
-   Suitable for automation/CI/CD
-   **Store securely**: Contains sensitive findings

**HTML Reports** (`~/.hephaestus/reports/*.html`):

-   Human-readable, ~50-250KB (depending on AI analysis)
-   Self-contained (no external resources)
-   Suitable for stakeholder presentation
-   **Redact before sharing externally**

**Best Practices:**

```bash
# Encrypt reports before email
gpg --encrypt --recipient client@example.com report.html

# Use secure file transfer
scp -i key.pem report.html user@secure-server:/reports/

# Set retention policy
find ~/.hephaestus/reports -mtime +90 -delete  # Delete after 90 days
```

3. **Document everything**: Logs, authorization, findings, communications
4. **Do no harm**: Never exploit, modify, or disrupt beyond authorized scope
5. **Disclose responsibly**: Give vendors time to fix before public disclosure
6. **Respect privacy**: Use local AI (Ollama) for sensitive infrastructure
7. **Stay legal**: One mistake can end your career and result in prosecution

### Final Reminder

**If you're unsure whether you have permission to scan a server, YOU DON'T.**

When in doubt:

1. Stop immediately
2. Get written authorization
3. Document the authorization
4. Verify scope clearly
5. Only then proceed

**Remember**: Your reputation and freedom depend on following these guidelines. Always err on the side of caution and proper authorization.
